	abstract = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling.},

A von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function has standard risk aversion if every risk that has a negative interaction with a small reduction in wealth also has a negative interaction with any undesirable, independent risk. It is shown that, given monotonicity and concavity, the combination of decreasing absolute risk aversion and decreasing absolute prudence is necessary and sufficient for standard risk aversion. Standard risk aversion is shown to imply not only Pratt and Zeckhauser's "proper risk aversion" (an undesirable risk always remaining undesirable in the presence of an independent undesirable risk), but also that being forced to face an undesirable risk reduces the optimal investment in a risky security with an independent return.},

The S-shaped value function hypothesis is based on experiments in which subjects are asked to choose separately between alternatives with either only positive or only negative outcomes, alternatives which rarely exist in the capital market. In addition, the S-shaped findings may be biased by the “certainty effect” and by probability distortion. In this paper we employ the recently developed prospect stochastic dominance criterion to test the prospect theory S-shaped value function hypothesis with mixed outcomes and with no “certainty effect.” Assuming that subjects do not distort moderate probabilities, we strongly reject the prospect theory S-shaped value function, with at least 76–86\% of the choices being inconsistent with such preferences. When possible subjective probability distortions are taken into account, we find that at least 50–66\% of the choices are inconsistent with an S-shaped value function.},

	abstract = {Since Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008, tail-risk hedging has become an increasingly important concern for investors. Traditional approaches, such as purchasing options or variance swaps as insurance, are often expensive, illiquid, and result in a substantial drag on performance. A more prudent, cost-effective way to maintain a constant risk exposure is to actively manage portfolio exposure according to the prevailing volatility level within underlying assets. The authors implement a robust methodology based on Dybvig's payoff distribution model to target a constant level of volatility and normalize monthly returns. This approach to portfolio and risk management can help investors obtain their desired risk exposures over both short and longer time frames, reduce exposure to tail risk, and in general increase portfolios' risk-adjusted performance.

	abstract = {It is often useful in economic analysis to formulate and test necessary conditions for optimizing behavior; this obviates the need for complete, and perhaps tenuous, maintained hypotheses on the objective function of the decision-maker. For example, the weak axiom of revealed preference can be tested without assuming a parametric family of preferences. For consumers who choose among uncertain alternatives by maximizing von Neumann-Morgenstern utility, it is also useful to identify necessary conditions and to develop methods that allow them to be tested econometrically. One such necessary condition is that an optimal prospect cannot be inferior to another feasible prospect for all increasing utility functions; this condition can be characterized in terms of stochastic dominance between distributions of payoffs.2 Hadar and Russell (1969, 1971, 1974a,b, 1978) introduced the concept of second-degree stochastic dominance for consumers with increasing, risk-averse utility functions; this has become an important tool in the analysis of choice under uncertainty. This paper develops statistical tests for stochastic dominance. Section 2 reviews the concept of stochastic dominance, and makes a few minor extensions to Hadar and Russell’s thorough characterization. Tests for first-degree and second-degree stochastic dominance are discussed in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. Section 5 discusses computation of the test statistics.},

	abstract = {In the last decade, a few models of portfolio construction have been proposed which apply second order stochastic dominance (SSD) as a choice criterion. SSD approach requires the use of a reference distribution which acts as a benchmark. The return distribution of the computed portfolio dominates the benchmark by the SSD criterion. The benchmark distribution naturally plays an important role since different benchmarks lead to very different portfolio solutions. In this paper we describe a novel concept of reshaping the benchmark distribution with a view to obtaining portfolio solutions which have enhanced return distributions. The return distribution of the constructed portfolio is considered enhanced if the left tail is improved, the downside risk is reduced and the standard deviation remains within a specified range. We extend this approach from long only to long-short strategies which are used by many hedge fund and quant fund practitioners. We present computational results which illustrate (1) how this approach leads to superior portfolio performance (2) how significantly better performance is achieved for portfolios that include shorting of assets.},

Vinod (2014) develops new generalized correlation coeﬃcients so that when r∗(Y{\textbar}X) {\textgreater} r∗(X{\textbar}Y) then X is the “kernel cause” of Y. Vinod (2015a) argues that kernel causality amounts to model selection between two kernel regressions, E(Y{\textbar}X) = g1(X) and E(X{\textbar}Y) = g2(Y) and reports simulations favoring kernel causality. An R software package called ‘generalCorr’ (at www.r-project.org) computes generalized correlations, partial correlations and plausible causal paths. This paper describes various R functions in the package, using examples to describe them. We are proposing an alternative quantiﬁcation to extensive causality apparatus of Pearl (2010) and additive-noise type methods in Mooij et al. (2014), who seem to oﬀer no R implementations. My methods applied to certain public benchmark data report a 70-75\% success rate. We also describe how to use the package to assess endogeneity of regressors.},

	abstract = {Gorton and Rouwenhorst (2006) examined commodity futures returns over the period July 1959 to December 2004 based on an equally-weighted index. They found that fully collateralized commodity futures had historically offered the same return and Sharpe ratio as U.S. equities, but were negatively correlated with the return on stocks and bonds.  Reviewing these results ten years later, we find that our conclusions largely hold up out-of-sample.  The in- and out-of-sample average commodity risk premiums are not significantly different, nor is the cross-sectional relationship between average returns and the basis. Correlations among commodities and commodity correlations with other assets experienced a temporary increase during the financial crisis which is in line with historical experience of variation of these correlations over the business cycle.},

	abstract = {Long‐only commodity futures returns have been very disappointing over the last decade, leading some to wonder if it was a mistake to invest in commodities. The poor performance is the result of poor “income returns” and not of falling commodity prices. This observation may be surprising for many commodity investors who were not aware, who misperceived, they were making a bet on income returns, a return building block similar to a stock’s dividend yield or a bond’s yield. For investors seeking an inflation hedge, it may be surprising that the historical linkage of commodity returns with inflation seems to be the result of a connection between commodity income returns and inflation, not, as commonly misperceived, commodity price returns and inflation. It may be surprising that the value of commodity investments is smaller than the market capitalization of Facebook, a potentially striking misperception for investors seeking a portfolio diversifier with abundant capacity. There has been no change in the way that price returns and income returns drive the total returns of stocks, bond and commodities. What has changed is that maybe a good number of commodity investors now realize that they were operating outside of their “circle of competence” and did not have a sense of what future price and income returns could be and would be.},

We find that actual trading costs are an order of magnitude smaller than previous studies suggest. In addition, we show that small portfolio changes to reduce transactions costs can increase the net returns and break-even capacities of these strategies substantially, with little tracking error. Use of live trading data from a real arbitrageur and portfolios designed to address trading costs give a vastly different portrayal of implementation costs than previous studies suggest. We conclude that the main capital market anomalies – size, value, and momentum – are robust, implementable, and sizeable in the face of transactions costs.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0010050},
	abstract = {Drawdowns are essential aspects of risk assessment in investment management. They offer a more natural measure of real market risks than the variance or other cumulants of daily (or some other fixed time scale) distributions of returns. Here, we extend considerably our previous analysis by analyzing the major financial indices, the major currencies, gold, the twenty largest U.S. companies in terms of capitalisation as well as nine others chosen randomly. We find for the major financial markets that approximately 98\% of the distributions of drawdowns is well-represented by a stretched exponential while the largest drawdowns are occurring with a significantly larger rate than predicted by the stretched exponential: the largest drops thus constitute genuine outliers. This is confirmed by extensive testing on surrogate data, which unambiguously show that large stock market drops (and crashes) cannot be accounted for by the distribution of returns characterising the smaller market moves. They thus belong to a different class of their own and call for a specific amplification mechanism. A similar scenario is found for the majority of the company stocks analysed. Drawups exhibit a similar behavior in only about half the markets that we examined. In the spirit of Bacon in Novum Organum about 400 years ago, ``Errors of Nature, Sports and Monsters correct the understanding in regard to ordinary things, and reveal general forms. For whoever knows the ways of Nature will more easily notice her deviations; and, on the other hand, whoever knows her deviations will more accurately describe her ways,'' we propose that outliers reveal fundamental properties of the stock market.},

Traditional approaches, such as purchasing options or variance swaps as insurance, are often expensive, illiquid, and result in a substantial drag on performance. A more prudent, cost-effective way to maintain a constant risk exposure is to actively manage portfolio exposure according to the prevailing volatility level within underlying assets. The authors implement a robust methodology based on Dybvig's payoff distribution model to target a constant level of volatility and normalize monthly returns. This approach to portfolio and risk management can help investors obtain their desired risk exposures over both short and longer time frames, reduce exposure to tail risk, and in general increase portfolios' risk-adjusted performance.

The modification amounts to resampling whole blocks of consecutive observations, or deleting whole blocks one at a time. Liu and Singh independently proposed (in 1988) the same technique for observations that are mmm-dependent. However, many time-series statistics, notably estimators of the spectral density function, involve parameters of the whole (infinite-dimensional) joint distribution and, hence, do not fit in this framework. In this report we generalize the "moving blocks" resampling scheme of Kunsch and Liu and Singh; a still modified version of the nonparametric bootstrap and jackknife is seen to be valid for general linear statistics that are asymptotically normal and consistent for a parameter of the whole joint distribution. We then apply this result to the problem of estimation of the spectral density.},

It is shown that, asymptotically, bootstrap estimators derived using any of the methods considered in the paper have the same amount of bias to the first order. However, the variances of these bootstrap estimators may be different even in the first order. Expansions for the bias, the variance and the mean-squared error of different block bootstrap variance estimators are obtained. It follows from these expansions that using overlapping blocks is to be preferred over nonoverlapping blocks and that using random block lengths typically leads to mean-squared errors larger than those for nonrandom block lengths.},

Journal of Finance, 36:889–908], which has been corrected by Memmel [Memmel, C. (2003). Performance hypothesis testing with the Sharpe ratio. Finance Letters, 1:21–23]. Unfortunately, this test is not valid when returns have tails heavier than the normal distribution or are of time series nature. Instead, we propose the use of robust inference methods. In particular, we suggest to construct a studentized time series bootstrap conﬁdence interval for the difference of the Sharpe ratios and to declare the two ratios different if zero is not contained in the obtained interval. This approach has the advantage that one can simply resample from the observed data as opposed to some null-restricted data. A simulation study demonstrates the improved ﬁnite sample performance compared to existing methods. In addition, two applications to real data are provided.},

	abstract = {This article introduces a resampling procedure called the stationary bootstrap as a means of calculating standard errors of estimators and constructing confidence regions for parameters based on weakly dependent stationary observations. Previously, a technique based on resampling blocks of consecutive observations was introduced to construct confidence intervals for a parameter of the m-dimensional joint distribution of m consecutive observations, where m is fixed. This procedure has been generalized by constructing a “blocks of blocks” resampling scheme that yields asymptotically valid procedures even for a multivariate parameter of the whole (i.e., infinite-dimensional) joint distribution of the stationary sequence of observations. These methods share the construction of resampling blocks of observations to form a pseudo-time series, so that the statistic of interest may be recalculated based on the resampled data set. But in the context of applying this method to stationary data, it is natural to require the resampled pseudo-time series to be stationary (conditional on the original data) as well. Although the aforementioned procedures lack this property, the stationary procedure developed here is indeed stationary and possesses other desirable properties. The stationary procedure is based on resampling blocks of random length, where the length of each block has a geometric distribution. In this article, fundamental consistency and weak convergence properties of the stationary resampling scheme are developed.},

	"First, many investors have large holdings of individual stocks; they may fail to diversify in the manner recommended by financial theory, or their holdings may be restricted by corporate compensation policies. These investors are affected by shifts in industry-level and idiosyncratic volatility, just as much as by shifts in market volatility. Second, some investors who do try to diversify do so by holding a portfolio of 20 or 30 stocks. Conventional wisdom holds that such a portfolio closely approximates a well-diversified portfolio in which all idiosyncratic risk is eliminated. However, the adequacy of this approximation depends on the level of idiosyncratic volatility in the stocks making up the portfolio. Third, arbitrageurs who trade to exploit the mispricing of an individual stock (as opposed to a pattern of mispricing across many stocks) face risks that are related to idiosyncratic return volatility, not aggregate market volatility. Larger pricing errors are possible when idiosyncratic firm-level volatility is high (Ingersoll (1987), Chapter 7, Shleifer and Vishny (1997)). Fourth, firm-level volatility is important in event studies. Events affect individual stocks, and the statistical significance of abnormal event-related returns is determined by the volatility of individual stock returns relative to the market or industry (Campbell et al. (1997), Chapter 4). Finally, the price of an option on an individual stock depends on the total volatility of the stock return, including industry-level and idiosyncratic volatility as well as market volatility."
	larger pricing errors could be a "systemic" risk as in pervasive if investors are using common pricing models.

In both cases, the estimator has the following properties. It is a function of a complete sufficient statistic and is therefore the unique (except for sets of probability zero) minimum variance unbiased estimator. Its range is the region of possible values of the estimated quantity. It is a strictly increasing function of the usual estimator differing from it only by terms of order $1/n$ and consequently having the same asymptotic distribution. Since the unbiased estimators are cumbersome in form in that they are expressed as series or integrals, tables are included giving the unbiased estimators as functions of the usual estimators. In Sec. 4 we give an unbiased estimator of the squared multiple correlation. It has the properties mentioned in the second paragraph except that it may be negative, which the squared multiple correlation cannot. In each case the estimator is obtained by inverting a Laplace transform. We are grateful to W. H. Kruskal and L. J. Savage for very helpful comments and suggestions, and to R. R. Blough for his able computations.},

Contrary to correlation analysis, this nonparametric measure is not predisposed toward the normal distribution and can allow for nonlinear relationships. Our estimates for the G-countries suggest that simultaneous crashes between stock markets are much more likely than between bond markets. However, for the assessment of financial system stability the widely disregarded cross-asset perspective is particularly important. For example, our data show that stock-bond contagion is approximately as frequent as flight to quality from stocks into bonds. Extreme cross-border linkages are surprisingly similar to national linkages, illustrating a potential downside to international financial integration.},

	abstract = {I assemble an annual time series of bid-ask spreads on Dow Jones stocks from 1900-2000, along with an annual estimate of the weighted-average commission rate for trading NYSE stocks since 1925. Spreads are cyclical, especially during periods of market turmoil. The sum of half-spreads and one-way commissions, multiplied by annual turnover, is an estimate of the annual proportional cost of aggregate equity trading. This cost drives a wedge between aggregate gross equity returns and net equity returns. This wedge can account for only a small part of the observed equity premium, but all else equal the gross equity premium is perhaps 1\% lower today than it was early in the 1900's. Finally, I present evidence that the transaction cost measures that also proxy for liquidity - spreads and turnover - predict stock returns one year or more ahead. High spreads predict high stock returns; high turnover predicts low stock returns. These liquidity variables dominate traditional predictor variables, such as the dividend yield. The evidence suggests that time-series variation in aggregate liquidity is an important determinant of conditional expected stock market returns.},

At the aggregate level, individual investors prefer stocks with lottery features, and like lottery demand, the demand for lottery-type stocks increases during economic downturns. In the cross-section, socioeconomic factors that induce greater expenditure in lotteries are associated with greater investment in lottery-type stocks. Further, lottery investment levels are higher in regions with favorable lottery environments. Because lottery-type stocks underperform, gambling-related underperformance is greater among low-income investors who excessively overweight lottery-type stocks. These results indicate that state lotteries and lottery-type stocks attract very similar socioeconomic clienteles.},

These results are robust to controls for size, book-to-market, momentum, short-term reversals, liquidity, and skewness.

I argue that individuals are attracted to lottery stocks because they are risk-seeking and sentiment-prone. Because risk preferences are not directly observable, I use a model-free approach based on stochastic dominance to infer aggregate risk preferences. I also use a direct measure of individual investor sentiment, the bull-bear spread, to test whether sentiment affects the returns of lottery stocks. My results show that lottery stock investors are indeed risk seekers. Sentiment also plays an important role in explaining the demand and returns of lottery versus nonlottery stocks. The lottery stock puzzle can thus be understood only by incorporating unusual risk preferences and the propensity for individual investors to trade on sentiment.},
