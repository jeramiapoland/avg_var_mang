	abstract = {Between 1934 and 1974, the Federal Reserve changed the initial margin requirement for the U.S. stock market 22 times. I use this variation to show that investors’ leverage constraints affect the pricing of risk. Consistent with earlier theoretical predictions, I ﬁnd that tighter leverage constraints result in a ﬂatter relation between betas and expected returns. My results provide strong empirical support for the idea that the constraints investors face may help explain the empirical failure of the capital asset pricing model.},

	"First, many investors have large holdings of individual stocks; they may fail to diversify in the manner recommended by financial theory, or their holdings may be restricted by corporate compensation policies. These investors are affected by shifts in industry-level and idiosyncratic volatility, just as much as by shifts in market volatility. Second, some investors who do try to diversify do so by holding a portfolio of 20 or 30 stocks. Conventional wisdom holds that such a portfolio closely approximates a well-diversified portfolio in which all idiosyncratic risk is eliminated. However, the adequacy of this approximation depends on the level of idiosyncratic volatility in the stocks making up the portfolio. Third, arbitrageurs who trade to exploit the mispricing of an individual stock (as opposed to a pattern of mispricing across many stocks) face risks that are related to idiosyncratic return volatility, not aggregate market volatility. Larger pricing errors are possible when idiosyncratic firm-level volatility is high (Ingersoll (1987), Chapter 7, Shleifer and Vishny (1997)). Fourth, firm-level volatility is important in event studies. Events affect individual stocks, and the statistical significance of abnormal event-related returns is determined by the volatility of individual stock returns relative to the market or industry (Campbell et al. (1997), Chapter 4). Finally, the price of an option on an individual stock depends on the total volatility of the stock return, including industry-level and idiosyncratic volatility as well as market volatility."
	larger pricing errors could be a "systemic" risk as in pervasive if investors are using common pricing models.

In both cases, the estimator has the following properties. It is a function of a complete sufficient statistic and is therefore the unique (except for sets of probability zero) minimum variance unbiased estimator. Its range is the region of possible values of the estimated quantity. It is a strictly increasing function of the usual estimator differing from it only by terms of order $1/n$ and consequently having the same asymptotic distribution. Since the unbiased estimators are cumbersome in form in that they are expressed as series or integrals, tables are included giving the unbiased estimators as functions of the usual estimators. In Sec. 4 we give an unbiased estimator of the squared multiple correlation. It has the properties mentioned in the second paragraph except that it may be negative, which the squared multiple correlation cannot. In each case the estimator is obtained by inverting a Laplace transform. We are grateful to W. H. Kruskal and L. J. Savage for very helpful comments and suggestions, and to R. R. Blough for his able computations.},

Contrary to correlation analysis, this nonparametric measure is not predisposed toward the normal distribution and can allow for nonlinear relationships. Our estimates for the G-countries suggest that simultaneous crashes between stock markets are much more likely than between bond markets. However, for the assessment of financial system stability the widely disregarded cross-asset perspective is particularly important. For example, our data show that stock-bond contagion is approximately as frequent as flight to quality from stocks into bonds. Extreme cross-border linkages are surprisingly similar to national linkages, illustrating a potential downside to international financial integration.},

At the aggregate level, individual investors prefer stocks with lottery features, and like lottery demand, the demand for lottery-type stocks increases during economic downturns. In the cross-section, socioeconomic factors that induce greater expenditure in lotteries are associated with greater investment in lottery-type stocks. Further, lottery investment levels are higher in regions with favorable lottery environments. Because lottery-type stocks underperform, gambling-related underperformance is greater among low-income investors who excessively overweight lottery-type stocks.

	abstract = {Lottery stocks are a puzzle: individual investors value these stocks highly despite their low average returns and high volatility (Kumar [2009]). I argue that individuals are attracted to lottery stocks because they are risk-seeking and sentiment-prone. Because risk preferences are not directly observable, I use a model-free approach based on stochastic dominance to infer aggregate risk preferences. I also use a direct measure of individual investor sentiment, the bull-bear spread, to test whether sentiment affects the returns of lottery stocks. My results show that lottery stock investors are indeed risk seekers. Sentiment also plays an important role in explaining the demand and returns of lottery versus nonlottery stocks. The lottery stock puzzle can thus be understood only by incorporating unusual risk preferences and the propensity for individual investors to trade on sentiment.},
