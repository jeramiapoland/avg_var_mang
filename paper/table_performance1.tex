  \caption{\textbf{:Portfolio Performance - Unconstrained} \newline
  	\footnotesize{This table displays portfolio performance measures for the AV and SV managed portfolio strategies using $c_{053}$ to target the annual volatility of the buy and hold market portfolio over the whole data set, 1926 to 2016. RET is the average annualized monthly log excess return. Sharpe, Sortino and Rachev are the Sharpe, Sortion and Rachev ratios respectively; Kappa$_{3}$ and Kappa$_{4}$ are the lower parital skewness and lower partial kurtosis Kappa measures. See section \ref{sec:asset_allocation} for details. No constraints are plased on the level of investment in the market portfolio for the AV and SV managed portfolio; the buy and hold strategy always has an investment weight of one in the market. Stars on the lines for the AV and SV managed portfolios indicate a significant postive performance difference between those two portfolios.}}
