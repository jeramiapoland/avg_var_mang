 abstract = {Standard predictive regressions produce biased coefficient estimates in small samples when the regressors are Gaussian first-order autoregressive with errors that are correlated with the error series of the dependent variable. See Stambaugh (1999) for the single regressor model. This paper proposes a direct and convenient method to obtain reduced-bias estimators for single and multiple regressor models by employing an augmented regression, adding a proxy for the errors in the autoregressive model. We derive bias expressions for both the ordinary least-squares and our reduced-bias estimated coefficients. For the standard errors of the estimated predictive coefficients, we develop a heuristic estimator that performs well in simulations, for both the single predictor model and an important specification of the multiple predictor model. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated by simulations and empirical estimates of common predictive models in finance. Our empirical results show that some of the predictive variables that were significant under ordinary least squares become insignificant under our estimation procedure.},

funds in the time series and cross-section. Hedge fund leverage is
counter-cyclical to the leverage of listed financial

when the market leverage of investment banks is highest. Changes
in hedge fund leverage tend to be more predictable by economy-wide
factors than by fund-specific characteristics. In particular,
decreases in funding costs and increases in market values both
forecast increases in hedge fund leverage. Decreases in fund

Redemptions and margin calls were the primary drivers of selloffs. Consistent with forced deleveraging, the selloffs took place in volatile and liquid stocks. In comparison, redemptions and stock sales for mutual funds were not as severe. We show that hedge fund investors withdraw capital three times as intensely as mutual fund investors do in response to poor returns.

By aggregating the matrix of explanatory variables in a simple way, our method transforms the original regression into an equivalent representation in which the dependent variables are non-overlapping. This transformation removes that part of the autocorrelation in the error terms which is induced by the overlapping scheme. Our method can easily be applied within standard software packages since conventional inference procedures (OLS-, White-, Newey-West-standard errors) are asymptotically valid when applied to the transformed regression. Through Monte Carlo analysis we show that it performs better in finite samples than the methods applied to the original regression that are in common usage. We illustrate the significance of our method with three empirical applications.},

The empirical evidence suggests that there is a relationship between domestic output growth and domestic stock returns which becomes stronger when foreign influences are considered. We study the properties of a model with two sources of disturbances and three mechanisms of transmission across countries. We show that the model can best reproduce the actual data when technology shocks drive the cycle and when there is a common international component to the shocks. The strength of association between stock returns and output growth depends on how future expected cash flows respond to the disturbances. International linkages emerge because foreign variables contain information about the future path of domestic variables."

abstract = {This paper examines whether self-described market timing hedge funds have the ability to time the U.S. equity market. We propose a new measure for timing return and volatility jointly that relates fund returns to the squared Sharpe ratio of the market portfolio. Using a sample of 221 market timing funds during 1994-2005, we find evidence of timing ability at both the aggregate and fund levels. Timing ability appears relatively strong in bear and volatile market conditions. Our findings are robust to other explanations, including public information-based strategies, options trading, and illiquid holdings. Bootstrap analysis shows that the evidence is unlikely to be attributed to luck.},

We use Hansen and Jagannathan's bounds on the mean and standard deviation of discount factors to survey several asset pricing puzzles. We then extend the bounds to reflect the correlation of discount factors with asset returns and to characterize conditional moments of discount factors. These characterizations help us to understand the behavior of a variety of models studied in the literature. We also incorporate borrowing constraints into the calculations. The borrowing constraints loosen the required properties of aggregate measurements of intertemporal marginal rates of substitution, but also sharpen the implications of asset market data for the marginal rates of substitution of unconstrained individuals. }

I find that the absence of dividend growth predictability gives stronger evidence than does the presence of return predictability. Long-horizon return forecasts give the same strong evidence. These tests exploit the negative correlation of return forecasts with dividend-yield autocorrelation across samples, together with sensible upper bounds on dividend-yield autocorrelation, to deliver more powerful statistics. I reconcile my findings with the literature that finds poor power in long-horizon return forecasts, and with the literature that notes the poor out-of-sample R 2 of return-forecasting regressions.},

abstract = {According to the dynamic version of the Gordon growth model, the long-run expected return on stocks, stock yield, is the sum of the dividend yield on stocks plus some weighted average of expected future growth rates in dividends. We construct a measure of stock yield based on sell-side analysts' near-term earnings forecasts that predicts US stock index returns well, with an out-of-sample R-squared that is consistently above 2{\%} at monthly frequency over our sample period. Stock yield also predicts future stock index returns in the US and other G7 countries and returns of US stock portfolios formed by sorting stocks based on firm characteristics, at various horizons. The findings are consistent with a single dominant factor driving expected returns on stocks over different holding periods. That single factor extracted from the cross section of stock yields using the Kelly and Pruitt (2013) partial regressions method predicts stock index returns better. The performance of the Binsbergen and Koijen (2010) latent factor model for forecasting stock returns improves significantly when stock yield is included as an imperfect observation of expected return on stocks. Consistent with folk wisdom, stock returns are more predictable coming out of a recession. Our measure performs as well in predicting stock returns as the implied cost of capital, another common stock yield measure that uses additional information.},

abstract = {We develop a model of hedge fund returns, which reflect the contractual relationships between a hedge fund, its investors and its prime brokers. These relationships are modelled as short option positions held by the hedge fund, wherein the ‚Äúfunding option‚Äù reflects the short option position with prime brokers and the ‚Äúredemption option‚Äù reflects the short option position with the investors. Given an alpha producing human capital, the hedge fund's ability to deploy leverage to magnify its alpha is shown to be sharply constrained by the presence of these short options, which have a high probability of being exercised in ‚Äúbad states‚Äù of the world, either due to poor performance or due to macroeconomic developments that are performance- independent. We show that the hedge funds typically have an optimal level of leverage that trades off rationally the ability to increase alpha with the risk of early exercise of short options, which may precipitate the liquidation of the fund. Optimal leverage is shown to differ across hedge funds reflecting their de-levering costs, Sharpe ratios, correlation of assets, secondary market liquidity of their assets, and the volatility of the assets. Using a minimum level of unencumbered cash level as a risk limit, we show how a hedge fund can optimally choose aggregate risk capital and then allocate its risk capital across different risk-taking units to maximize alpha in the presence of these short option positions. Implications of our analysis for hedge fund investors and policy makers are summarized. Our framework can be easily modified to study portfolio selection problem facing any fund, which has granted redemption rights to its investors (money market funds, long-only funds, etc).},

We propose a family of tests whose asymptotic power functions are tangent to the power envelope at one point and are never far below the envelope. When the series has no deterministic component, some previously proposed tests are shown to be asymptotically equivalent to members of this family. When the series has an unknown mean or linear trend, commonly used tests are found to be dominated by members of the family of point-optimal invariant tests. We propose a modified version of the Dickey-Fuller t test which has substantially improved power when an unknown mean or trend is present.

(1) High autocorrelation causes the variance of expected returns to grow faster than the return horizon. (2) The growth of the variance of unexpected returns with the return horizon is attenuated by a discount-rate effect - shocks to expected returns generate opposite shocks to current prices. We estimate that, on average, the future price increases implied by higher expected returns are just offset by the decline in the current price. Thus, time-varying expected returns generate ëtemporaryí components of prices."

Negative shocks to fundamentals make margin constraints bind, lowering risk-free rates and raising Sharpe ratios of risky securities, especially for high-margin securities. Such a funding-liquidity crisis gives rise to ìbases,î that is, price gaps between securities with identical cash-flows but different margins. In the time series, bases depend on the shadow cost of capital, which can be captured through the interest-rate spread between collateralized and uncollateralized loans and, in the cross-section, they depend on rela- tive margins.We test the model empirically using the credit default swapñbond bases and other deviations from the Law of One Price, and use it to evaluate central banks' lending facilities.},

 abstract = {We use a repeated survey of an Italian bank's clients to test whether investors' risk aversion increases following the 2008 financial crisis. We find that both a qualitative and a quantitative measure of risk aversion increases substantially after the crisis. After considering standard explanations, we investigate whether this increase might be an emotional response (fear) triggered by a scary experience. To show the plausibility of this conjecture, we conduct a lab experiment. We find that subjects who watched a horror movie have a certainty equivalent that is 27% lower than the ones who did not, supporting the fear-based explanation. Finally, we test the fear-based model with actual trading behavior and find consistent evidence.},

to other available robust linear trend tests, our proposed test

procedure is conservative and a modification for this situation is
suggested. An estimator of the trend parameter, together with an
associated confidence interval, which is asymptotically efficient,

consider the situation in which two forecasts of the same variable
are available. The possibility exists of forming a combined
forecast as a weighted average of the individual ones and
estimating the weights that should be optimally attached to each
forecast. If the entire weight should optimally be associated with
one forecast, that forecast is said to encompass the other. A
natural test for forecast encompassing is based on least squares
regression. We find, however, that the null distribution of this
test statistic is not robust to nonnormality in the forecast
errors. We discuss several alternative tests that are robust. CR -

In contrast with the widely used Baker and Wurgler (2006) sentiment index, our aligned index eliminates the common noise com- ponent of multiple sentiment proxies. Empirically, we find that our index has greater power in predicting the aggregate stock market than the Baker and Wurgler (2006) index: it increases the predictive R2s by more than five times both in-sample and out- of-sample, and outperforms any of the well recognized macroeconomic variables. The predictability is both statistically and economically significant. Moreover, our new index improves substantially the forecasting power too for the cross-sectional stock returns formed on industry, size, value, and momentum. Finally, consistent with Baker andWurgler (2007), we show that the driving force of the predictive power of investor sentiment stems from investors' biased belief about future cash flows.},

In general, very little market movement is observed when insiders trade and when they report their trades to the SEC. Insiders in aggregate are contrarian investors. However, they predict market movements better than simple contrarian strategies. Insiders also seem to be able to predict cross-sectional stock returns. The result, however, is driven by insiderís ability to predict returns in smaller firms. In addition, informativeness of insidersí activities is coming from purchases, while insider selling appears to have no predictive ability.}

We present a model of hedge funds' optimal asset allocation in the presence of coordination risk among investors. We show that hedge fund managers behave conservatively and even abstain from participating in the market once coordination risk is factored into their investment decisions.

An estimate of implied risk premium based on the average of four commonly used methods after making adjustments for predictable errors exhibits strong correlations with future realized returns as well as the lowest measurement error. Overall, our results confirm the validity of implied cost of equity estimates as measures of expected returns.

Yet, prices of investment goods, the main input into new installed capital, are countercyclical. We exploit this information to identify the driving forces of the business cycle and the nature of capital installation costs. In our model installation costs are increasing in the growth of investment, and the business cycle is driven by permanent investment-specific technology shocks and transitory neutral technology shocks. When calibrated to the capital price observations, the model does well at accounting for the main features of asset returns and the business cycle of macroeconomic aggregates. In addition, unlike most other models, our's accounts for sectoral comovement in both output and factor inputs.},

@article{Neely2014,
abstract = {Academic research relies extensively on macroeconomic variables to forecast the U.S. equity risk premium, with relatively little attention paid to the technical indicators widely employed by practitioners. Our paper fills this gap by comparing the predictive ability of technical indicators with that of macroeconomic variables. Technical indicators display statistically and economically significant in-sample and out-of-sample predictive power, matching or exceeding that of macroeconomic variables. Furthermore, technical indicators and macroeconomic variables provide complementary information over the business cycle: technical indicators better detect the typical decline in the equity risk premium near business-cycle peaks, whereas macroeconomic variables more readily pick up the typical rise in the equity risk premium near cyclical troughs. Consistent with this behavior, we show that combining information from both technical indicators and macroeconomic variables significantly improves equity risk premium forecasts versus using either type of information alone. Overall, the substantial countercyclical fluctuations in the equity risk premium appear well captured by the combined information in technical indicators and macroeconomic variables.

@article{Perron2009,
abstract = {We propose a test for the slope of a trend function when it is a priori unknown whether the series is trend-stationary or contains an autoregressive unit root. The procedure is based on a Feasible Quasi Generalized Least Squares method from an AR(1) specification with parameter $\alpha$, the sum of the autoregressive coefficients. The estimate of $\alpha$ is the OLS estimate obtained from an autoregression applied to detrended data and is truncated to take a value 1 whenever the estimate is in a T- $\delta$ neighborhood of 1. This makes the estimate "super-efficient" when $\alpha$ = 1 and implies that inference on the slope parameter can be performed using the standard Normal distribution whether $\alpha$ = 1 or | $\alpha$ | {\textless} 1. Theoretical arguments and simulation evidence show that $\delta$ = 1 / 2 is the appropriate choice. Simulations show that our procedure has better size and power properties than the tests proposed by [Bunzel, H., Vogelsang, T.J., 2005.

However, since individual stock returns share a common sensitivity to true market return shocks, higher aggregate risk can be revealed by higher correlation between stocks. In addition, a change in stock market variance that leaves aggregate risk unchanged can have a zero or even negative effect on the stock market risk premium. We show that the average correlation between daily stock returns predicts subsequent quarterly stock market excess returns. We also show that changes in stock market risk holding average correlation constant can be interpreted as changes in the average variance of individual stocks. Such changes have a negative relation with future stock market excess returns. }

The priceñoutput ratio tracks long-term U.S. cumulative stock returns almost as well as the cay-ratio of Lettau and Ludvigson [2001a. Journal of Finance 56, 815ñ849, 2005.

The priceñoutput ratio, however, involves no parameter estimation and is easily constructed for non-U.S. countries."

Combining delivers statistically and economically sig- nificant out-of-sample gains relative to the historical average consistently over time. We provide two empirical explanations for the benefits of forecast combination: (i) combining forecasts incorporates information from numerous economic variables while substantially reducing forecast volatility; (ii) combination forecasts are linked to the real economy},

We focus on U.S. equity premium forecastability and illustrate key issues via an empirical application based on updated data. Some studies argue that, despite extensive in-sample evidence of equity premium predictability, popular predictors from the literature fail to outperform the simple historical average benchmark forecast in out-of-sample tests. Recent studies, however, provide improved forecasting strategies that deliver statistically and economically significant out-of-sample gains relative to the historical average benchmark. These strategies - including economically motivated model restrictions, forecast combination, diffusion indices, and regime shifts - improve forecasting performance by addressing the substantial model uncertainty and parameter instability surrounding the data-generating process for stock returns. In addition to the U.S. equity premium, we succinctly survey out-of-sample evidence supporting U.S. cross-sectional and international stock return forecastability. The significant evidence of stock return forecastability worldwide has important implications for the development of both asset pricing models and investment management strategies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Rappoport1994,
abstract = {This article looks at the factors that resulted to the crash of the stock market in 1929 and 1987. Most of the 42-percent gain of the market in 1987 was erased by a two-day decline of 23 percent in October. Similarly, as measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the market had gained almost 50 percent in 1928 and 25 percent in 1929. Then, on October 28 and 29, 1929, the index fell 23 percent. Some observers have argued that these were the outcome of the collapse of self-fulfilling rational bubbles because there was no apparent large shift in any fundamental factor. Examining the S{\&}P 500 futures options for evidence of expectations of a crash, researcher David Bates suggested that the 1987 crash had, ex post, the appearance of a rational bubble, with the dramatic gains of one year suddenly erased. In a model for pricing these options with a jump-diffusion process, he found that the parameters implied by market prices indicated that a crash was expected and that implicit distributions were negatively skewed. In this paper the authors find similar evidence of a fear of a crash in 1929 well in advance of the event. While there were no well-organized options markets in the 1920s, there was a very active market in brokers' loans, which were collateralized by stock. Using monthly data on time loans, implied volatility was measured by pricing these loans as options. Section I discusses the stylized facts about the 1929 bull market and the characteristics of brokers' loans. Section II develops the appropriate options-pricing model for brokers' loans, and Section III examines the implied volatilities produced by the data. Conclusions are presented in Section IV.},

I find that margin requirements, when there are no other market frictions, reduce the volatility and correlation of returns as well as the risk-free rate, but increase the market price of risk, the risk premium, and the price of risky assets. Furthermore, margin requirements generate a strong cross-sectional dispersion of stock return volatilities. The results emphasize that a general equilibrium analysis may reverse the conclusions of a partial equilibrium analysis often employed in the literature.},

I argue that momentum crashes are due to crowded trades which push prices away from fundamentals leading to strong reversals, and exacerbated by limits of arbitrage being more severe in the short-leg due to impediments to short selling. Using short interest and institutional ownership data together to measure the "crowdedness" of momentum, I show that momentum crashes can be avoided in the cross section by shorting only non-crowded losers. There is considerably more short-covering during times when momentum fails. I show using high frequency short sale transactions data that short covering is especially severe in the crowded loser portfolio. A placebo test using a set of 63 futures contracts show that momentum crashes do not exist in futures market after market exposure is correctly hedged, which is consistent with my hypothesis.},
