		\caption{\textbf{:Portfolio Performance - Constrained} \newline
			\footnotesize{This table displays portfolio performance measures for the AV and SV managed portfolio strategies using $c_{10}$, $c_{12}$, and $c_{BH}$  to target the annual volatilities of 10\%, 12\%  and equal to the buy hold market portfolio over the whole data set, 1926 to 2016. Performance ratios are calculated for investment constraints of a maximum of 1.5 and 3, 50\% and 200\% leverage. RET is the average annualized monthly log excess return. Sharpe and Sortino are the Sharpe and Sortino ratios respectively; Kappa$_{3}$ and Kappa$_{4}$ are the lower partial skewness and lower partial kurtosis Kappa measures. See section \ref{sec:asset_allocation} for details. No constraints are placed on the level of investment in the market portfolio for the AV and SV managed portfolio; the buy and hold strategy always has an investment weight of one in the market. Stars on the lines for the AV and SV managed portfolios indicate a significant positive performance difference between those two portfolios.}}
