macro:->"When
leverage
works,
it
magnifies
your
gains.
Your
spouse
thinks
you're
clever,
and
your
neighbors
get
envious,...but
leverage
is
addictive.
Once
having
profited
from
its
wonders,
very
few
people
retreat
to
more
conservative
practices.
And
as
we
all
learned
in
third
grade
—
and
some
relearned
in
2008
—
any
series
of
positive
numbers,
however
impressive
the
numbers
may
be,
evaporates
when
multiplied
by
a
single
zero.
History
tells
us
that
leverage
all
too
often
produces
zeroes,
even
when
it
is
employed
by
very
smart
people."

the

very

The

the
