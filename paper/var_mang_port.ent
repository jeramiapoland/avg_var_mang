macro:->CRSP
has,
as

2005,
backfilled
NYSE
daily
returns
to
1926,
however
the
pre-1962
data
is
very
different
from
the
post-1962
data.
The
earlier
data
is
much
shallower
having
months
with
fewer
than
400
assets
total
that
meet
the
data
requirements.
Twice
as
many
firms
covering
twice
as
many
industries
are
available
at
the
end
of
1962
as
compared
to
the
end
of
1961.
And,
as
documented
in
\citet
{jones_century_2002}
the
pre-1962
period
is
significantly
and
persistantly
more
illiquid.
