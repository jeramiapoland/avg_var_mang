Certainly, US equity investors and fund managers are better served by the AV managed portfolio than the SV. However clear this conclusion, it raises the questions of generalization. Does the AV manged strategy work in equity markets outside of the US and does it still outperform the SV managed strategy? Testing the performance of AV management outside of US equities is even more important as confirmation of the argument that AV management works because returns to the AV managed portfolio depend more on AC and thus are more aligned with systematic risk. If AV management aligns better with systematic risk it should perform across assets.
