	abstract = {Using over a trillion dollars of live trading data from a large institutional money manager across 21 developed equity markets over a 16-year period, we measure the real-world transactions costs and price impact function facing an arbitrageur and apply them to trading strategies based on empirical asset pricing anomalies. We find that actual trading costs are an order of magnitude smaller than previous studies suggest. In addition, we show that small portfolio changes to reduce transactions costs can increase the net returns and break-even capacities of these strategies substantially, with little tracking error. Use of live trading data from a real arbitrageur and portfolios designed to address trading costs give a vastly different portrayal of implementation costs than previous studies suggest. We conclude that the main capital market anomalies – size, value, and momentum – are robust, implementable, and sizeable in the face of transactions costs.},
