	abstract = {Margin credit, deﬁned as the excess debt capacity of investors buying securities on the margin, is a very strong predictor of aggregate stock returns. It outperforms other forecasting variables proposed in the literature, in-sample as well as out-of-sample. Its out-of-sample R2, 7.45\% at the monthly horizon and 35.68\% at the annual horizon, is more than twice as large as that of the next best predictor. It produces a Sharpe Ratio of 1.42 over recessions and 0.96 over expansions and overall annualized Certainty Equivalent Return gain of 9.5\%, all considerably larger than those for the other predictors. Further, margin credit predicts market crashes and avoids substantial parts of the stock market downturns around 2001 and 2008. Margin credit predicts future returns because it contains information about future discount rates as well as future cash ﬂows.},
