The effectiveness of either SV or AV as an investment management signal will be driven by their relationship with future risk and return. It is the trade-off which is key to the leverage management strategy. Assuming that investors hold a portfolio with whose risk-return ratio they are indifferent, when risk increases but expected returns do not, the risk-return ratio become more unattractive and any risk-averse investor would like to decrease there position. Conversely, when the risk goes down without a decrease in return there is an opportunity to leverage into the position and return to the previous level of risk but now with a magnified return.

\citet{pollet_average_2010} argue that average correlation is a better measure of systematic market risk. Increases in average correlation are related to a higher covariance between labor income growth and the stock market, and the stock market and bond returns. Also, they show that in the context of Rollâ€™s Critique, average correlation should be a better indicator of risk for the true market portfolio rather than stock market variance. \citep{roll_critique_1977} The quarterly regressions in \citet{pollet_average_2010} show AC is related to higher returns in the following quarter.
