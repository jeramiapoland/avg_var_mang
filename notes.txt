		1:	Market variance != future returns (papers)
			M & M use market variance to manage investment in time series limits risk for level of return
			Like a portfolio optimization (Markowitz)
			However, Var(P) = sum sum ....
			PW show Var (P) = sum sum (wwcov) = sum sum (wwpstdstd) ... = ac*av
				r_t+1 = b * ac where b > 0
				cor(r_t+1,av) = 0
			M&M in month t, c/(sig2) for t + 1
			I say c/(av) for t + 1
			With either SV or AV target a set volatility overtime and maximize returns by moving in and out
			
		2: 	PW argue that AC is systemic and related to agg wealth including the unobser market componet (Roll)
			starts with Campbell and Viceira (3)
			[first 3 lines of (4)] ... shocks to stocks returns has variance (1-theta)*sigma + theta*sigma where theta porportion shock to common stock market component
			...(8)
			AC term positive but small if the market is not a large part of aggregate wealth, Ws, or the risk premium on the market is 
			AV term negative
			intuitively = (translate above)
			PW leave this theoretically, I'll offer some suggestive evidence that AV management shows AV is not systematic
			AC is no longer postively related to future returns on a subset where daily returns are a poorer proxy for the unobs market and stocks not significant part of agg wealth
			AV management works in international markets
			AV management works across asset class (equity AV can manage non-equity assets but SV cannot)
